### Responsive Design Or Separate Mobile Website?
There is no argument here: Every company with a website has to deliver mobile visitors a great user experience (UX). With more than half of all Internet traffic coming from mobile devices, no business can afford to limp along with a desktop-only site.


### Which is better?
Responsive design is a web design technique that enables your website pages to automatically adjust for optimal viewing on desktops, tablets and mobile phones. With responsive design, you have only one website to manage.

A separate mobile website is just that — a second company website designed for and used by mobile viewers only. It has its own URL, navigation, page structure, content, design, etc.

### Advantages of Responsive Web Design
Generally, a responsive website is the most practical and effective way to go. Obviously, it’s more efficient to manage one website versus two. Beyond that …

- having two websites confuses visitors who want to visit you online via mobile phone and desktop.
- hacving two websites dilutes SEO, and is likely to increase the cost and complexity of SEO, PPC and other forms of Internet marketing.

### Advantages of a Separate Mobile Website
A separate mobile website has one advantage — delivering the best possible UX to mobile users. A mobile website gives designers complete freedom to cater to mobile user preferences. For instance, a mobile site can be jam-packed with images and video with very little content, and can have a slimmed-down shopping cart for 10 of the most popular products rather than the desktop site that has a complex cart for 1,000 items.

A separate mobile site may be the better option if …

- Your company has an extensive e-commerce site and wants to offer mobile users a simpler shopping experience.
- Your company has a very high percentage of mobile traffic.
- Your company has a very high percentage of mobile conversions.
