### DNS Hierarchy
- DNS uses a hierarchy to manage its distributed database system. The DNS hierarchy, also called the domain name space, is an inverted tree structure, much like eDirectory.

- The DNS tree has a single domain at the top of the structure called the root domain. A period or dot (.) is the designation for the root domain. Below the root domain are the top-level domains that divide the DNS hierarchy into segments.

- Listed below are the top-level DNS domains and the types of organizations that use them. Below the top-level domains, the domain name space is further divided into subdomains representing individual organizations.


- Under Root (13) Domain Service, there are some top-level domains, such as `.com, .edu, .gov, .mil, .org, .net .int` 

- Additional top-level domains organize domain name space geographically. For example, the top-level domain for France is fr.
